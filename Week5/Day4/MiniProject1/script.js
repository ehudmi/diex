// Select a color
// Draw what you want

// Project Brief
// Welcome to Coloring Squares.

// Your task is to build a coloring game similar to the working project above.

// You will need to use HTML, CSS and JS to accomplish this task.

// A Few Things To Think About…
// HTML, CSS:

// How will you make the grid of colors?
// How will you make the grid of blank squares?
// Hint… GRID :P
// JS:

// How does a user choose a color?
// How does drawing work? How can you tell when the user is clicking and dragging?
// Hint, look at the JS events mousedown, mouseup, and mouseover.
