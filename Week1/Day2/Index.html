      <h1>The lions</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
        savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal
        than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night
        and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related
        females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20
        adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females
        cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including
        antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
