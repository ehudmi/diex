              Loki (Pronounced as \ˈlō-kē\[1]) is a god in Norse mythology.
              According to some sources, Loki is the son of Fárbauti (a jötunn)
              and Laufey (mentioned as a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi
              and Býleistr. Loki is married to Sigyn and they have a son, Narfi
              and/or Nari. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel,
              the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. Loki, in the
              form of a mare, was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and
              gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Loki is referred to
              as the father of Váli in Prose Edda, though this source also
              refers to Odin as the father of Váli twice, and Váli is found
              mentioned as a son of Loki only once. Loki's relation with the
              gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and
              sometimes behaves maliciously towards them. Loki is a shape
              shifter and in separate incidents appears in the form of a salmon,
              a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse
              'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his
              role in engineering the death of the god Baldr, and eventually,
              Váli binds Loki with the entrails of one of his sons.

              In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the goddess Skaði is
              responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The
              serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a
              bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the
              venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain,
              thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of Ragnarök, Loki is
              foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods
              among the forces of the jötnar, at which time he will encounter
              the god Heimdallr, and the two will slay each other. Loki is
              referred to in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from
              earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla,
              written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; the Norwegian
              Rune Poems, in the poetry of skalds, and in Scandinavian folklore.
              Loki may be depicted on the Snaptun Stone, the Kirkby Stephen
              Stone, and the Gosforth Cross. Scholars have debated Loki's
              origins and role in Norse mythology, which some have described as
              that of a trickster god. Loki has been depicted in or is
              referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.
