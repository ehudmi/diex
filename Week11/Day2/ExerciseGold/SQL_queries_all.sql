-- Exercise 1 : DVD Rentals
-- Instructions
-- Get a list of all rentals which are out (have not been returned). How do we identify these films in the database?

-- Get a list of all customers who have not returned their rentals. Make sure to group your results.

-- Get a list of all the Action films with Joe Swank.
-- Before you start, could there be a shortcut to getting this information? Maybe a view?


-- Exercise 2 – Happy Halloween
-- Instructions
-- There is a zombie plague approaching! The DVD rental company is offering to lend all of 
-- its DVDs to the local shelters, so that the citizens can watch the movies together in the shelters 
-- until the zombies are destroyed by the armed forces. Prepare tables with the following data:

-- How many stores there are, and in which city and country they are located.

-- How many hours of viewing time there are in total in each store – in other words,
-- the sum of the length of every inventory item in each store.

-- Make sure to exclude any inventory items which are not yet returned.
-- (Yes, even in the time of zombies there are people who do not return their DVDs)

-- A list of all customers in the cities where the stores are located.

-- A list of all customers in the countries where the stores are located.

-- Some people will be frightened by watching scary movies while zombies walk the streets.
-- Create a ‘safe list’ of all movies which do not include the ‘Horror’ category,
-- or contain the words ‘beast’, ‘monster’, ‘ghost’, ‘dead’, ‘zombie’, or ‘undead’ in their titles or descriptions…
-- Get the sum of their viewing time (length).
-- Hint : use the CHECK contraint

-- For both the ‘general’ and the ‘safe’ lists above, also calculate the time in hours and days (not just minutes).
