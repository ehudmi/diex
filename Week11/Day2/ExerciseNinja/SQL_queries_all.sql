-- Exercise 1 : DVD Rentals
-- Instructions
-- We want to encourage families and kids to enjoy our movies.

-- Retrieve all films with a rating of G or PG, which are are not currently rented (they have been returned/have never been borrowed).

-- Create a new table which will represent a waiting list for children’s movies.
-- This will allow a child to add their name to the list until the DVD is available (has been returned).
-- Once the child takes the DVD, their name should be removed from the waiting list (ideally using triggers,
-- but we have not learned about them yet. Let’s assume that our Python program will manage this).
-- Which table references should be included?

-- Retrieve the number of people waiting for each children’s DVD. Test this by adding rows to
-- the table that you created in question 2 above.
