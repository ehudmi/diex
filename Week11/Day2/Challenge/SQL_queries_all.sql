-- Daily Challenge: Tables Relationships
-- Instructions
-- You are going to practice tables relationships

-- Part I

-- Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.
-- A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
-- The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
-- The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean),
-- customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)

-- Insert those customers
-- John, Doe
-- Jerome, Lalu
-- Lea, Rive
CREATE TABLE customer (id SERIAL , first_name VARCHAR(50), last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE customer_profile
(id SERIAL, isLoggedIn BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, customer_id INTEGER);
INSERT INTO customer (first_name, last_name) 
VALUES ('John', 'Doe'), ('Jerome', 'Lalu'), ('Lea', 'Rive');

-- 3.Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries
-- John is loggedIn
-- Jerome is not logged in
INSERT INTO customer_profile (isLoggedIn,customer_id) 
(SELECT 't',id FROM customer WHERE first_name ='John');

INSERT INTO customer_profile (isLoggedIn,customer_id) 
(SELECT 'f',id FROM customer WHERE first_name ='Jerome');


-- Use the relevant types of Joins to display:
-- The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
SELECT first_name FROM customer cu
INNER JOIN customer_profile cp ON cu.id=cp.customer_id
WHERE cp.isLoggedIn='t';
-- All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.
SELECT first_name, cp.isLoggedIn FROM customer cu
LEFT JOIN customer_profile cp ON cu.id=cp.customer_id;
-- The number of customers that are not LoggedIn
SELECT COUNT(cu.id) FROM customer cu
INNER JOIN customer_profile cp ON cu.id=cp.customer_id
WHERE cp.isLoggedIn!='t';

-- Part II:

-- Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

-- Insert those books :
-- Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
-- Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
-- To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

-- Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age.
-- Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

-- Insert those students:
-- John, 12
-- Lera, 11
-- Patrick, 10
-- Bob, 14
CREATE TABLE Book (book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO Book (title, author)
VALUES
('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),
('Harry Potter', 'J.K Rowling'),
('To kill a mockingbird', 'Harper Lee');
CREATE TABLE Student
(student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL UNIQUE, age INTEGER CHECK (age<=15));
INSERT INTO Student (name, age)
VALUES
('John', 12),
('Lera', 11),
('Patrick', 10),
('Bob', 14);
-- Create a table named Library, with the columns :
-- book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- borrowed_date
-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables :
-- A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table
CREATE TABLE Library
(book_fk_id INTEGER ,
 student_id INTEGER ,
 borrowed_date DATE,
FOREIGN KEY (book_fk_id) REFERENCES book(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
PRIMARY KEY (book_fk_id,student_id));
-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021
INSERT INTO library (book_fk_id,
					   student_id,
					   borrowed_date)
VALUES(
(SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland'),
(SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name ILIKE '%John%'),
	'15/02/2022'
),
(
(SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'To kill a mockingbird'),
(SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name ILIKE '%Bob%'),
	'03/03/2021'
),
(
(SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland'),
(SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name ILIKE '%Lera%'),
	'23/05/2021'
),
(
(SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'Harry Potter'),
(SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name ILIKE '%Bob%'),
	'12/08/2021'
);
-- Display the data
-- Select all the columns from the junction table
SELECT * FROM library;
-- Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
SELECT s.name, b.title FROM library l
INNER JOIN student s ON l.student_id=s.student_id
INNER JOIN book b ON l.book_fk_id=b.book_id;
-- Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland
SELECT b.title, AVG(s.age) FROM library l
INNER JOIN student s ON l.student_id=s.student_id
INNER JOIN book b ON l.book_fk_id=b.book_id
WHERE b.title='Alice In Wonderland'
GROUP BY b.title;
-- Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?
-- Answer: The cascaded delete removed the row for that student from the library table
